My websites have gone through different tech stacks over the years.

First was maybe... `geocities`? üòä  
Just kidding, that doesn't really count.

Eventually, I used [LEMP stack](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/what-is-lemp).

Then my [server host](https://www.digitalocean.com) upped the amount of RAM available on my server at no charge, and `.NET Core` had just came out, so I swapped out PHP for `ASP .NET Core MVC`. It's no secret I love `C#`.

But recently, while working on my site's admin pages, I realized I have big limitations using a backend database and memcache, so I decided to use a static site instead in the form of [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). It's been nice to work with and converting the site over was relatively painless.

The nice part of using Gatsby is being able to write posts in `markdown`, and not have to maintain a database nor tweak my custom admin pages (I don't need an admin at all anymore). My "admin" is now essentially just an editor that understands markdown. For this, I use [Obsidian Note](https://obsidian.md).

Both Gatsby and Obsidian Note were recommendations from `@ElementCy` of [EAT Studios](https://eat-studios.com) ‚ù§Ô∏è
